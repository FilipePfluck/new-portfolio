As such, I try to make my applications as accessible as possible, by enabling keyboard navigation, respecting WAI-ARIA standards, making the HTML semantic and ensuring proper announcement by the screen reader. I also write tests to ensure my components remain functional and accessible throughout all the phases of development. Don't you believe me? Feel free to test this website as you wish.",
